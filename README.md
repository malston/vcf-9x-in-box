# VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.x in a Box

Deploy a fully functional VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 9.x environment on a single or dual physical ESXi host, optimized for development and lab use. This setup enables users to explore and learn VCF with minimal compute and storage resources.

üìí This deployment does not use Nested ESXi and instead runs directly on physical hosts, in contrast to the [VCF Holodeck 9.0](https://vmware.github.io/Holodeck/) solution.

**Perfect for:** Understanding the complete deployment process and how each piece fits together.

## Using the Makefile

This project includes a comprehensive Makefile to simplify common tasks. No need to remember complex `uv` or Python commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Show project configuration info
make info
```

### Python Setup

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
make setup

# Install dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
make sync

# Clean up virtual environment and generated files
make clean
```

### Generate ESXi Kickstart Configs

```bash
# Generate all kickstart configs (esx01, esx02, esx03)
make generate

# Generate config for specific host
make generate-1   # For esx01
make generate-2   # For esx02
make generate-3   # For esx03

# Or use: make generate-host HOST=3
```

### Create Bootable USB

```bash
# List available disk devices
make usb-list

# Create bootable USB for specific host
make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=1
make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=3
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# Clean, setup, and generate all configs
make all
```

### Customizing Configuration

All configuration is now managed via YAML. To customize host configurations:

1. Edit `config/vcf-config.yaml` (network settings, IPs, NVMe disks, etc.)
2. Run `make generate` to regenerate all configs

**Example customizations:**

```yaml
# config/vcf-config.yaml
network:
  gateway: "172.30.0.1"  # Change gateway
  vlan_id: "30"          # Change VLAN

hosts:
  - number: 1
    ip: "172.30.0.10"    # Change IP
    install_disk: "..."   # Update NVMe device ID
```

**Using custom config files:**

```bash
make generate CONFIG=config/my-custom-config.yaml
```

See [PYTHON_SETUP.md](PYTHON_SETUP.md) for detailed Python environment information.

## Quick Start

1. **Prepare hardware** (3x MS-A2 or similar with specs below)
2. **Configure network** (5 VLANs: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)
3. **Setup VCF Offline Depot** on HTTP server
4. **Download ESXi 9.0.0.0 ISO** (build 24755229) - See [Software Requirements](#software-requirements)
5. **Generate kickstart configs:** `make generate`
6. **Create ESXi USB installers:** `make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=1` (repeat for each host)
7. **Deploy ESXi 9.0.0.0** on all hosts (automated via kickstart) - **This MUST be done before VCF Installer deployment**
8. **Deploy VCF Installer:** `make deploy-vcf-installer`
9. **Configure VCF Installer:** `make setup-vcf-installer`
10. **Connect to Offline Depot** and download binaries
11. **Upload VCF deployment manifest** and start deployment
12. **Run storage policy fix** (two-node only): `make fix-vsan-policy`

**Total deployment time:** 3-4 hours

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** All physical ESXi hosts must be running **ESXi 9.0.0.0 build 24755229** before deploying the VCF Installer (Step 8).

**Tip:** Use `make help` to see all available Makefile commands.

## Installation

0. Update to the latest Firmware on the MS-A2 (if applicable) by following [these instructions](https://williamlam.com/2025/07/quick-tip-updating-firmware-on-minisforum-ms-a2.html).

1. Setup a VCF Offline Depot using the new `VCF Download Tool` by following the [Broadcom doumentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/deploying-a-new-vmware-cloud-foundation-or-vmware-vsphere-foundation-private-cloud-/preparing-your-environment/downloading-binaries-to-the-vcf-installer-appliance/download-install-binaries-to-an-offline-depot.html)

After downloading the required metadata/binaries, you should have a directory structure like the following:

19 directories, 15 files
```

You can host the VCF Offline Depot using a traditional HTTP Web Server (HTTPS is NOT required as the automation in 9 will disable HTTPS). Alternatively, you can simply use Python to serve up the directory (see this [blog post](https://williamlam.com/2025/06/using-http-with-vcf-9-0-installer-for-offline-depot.html)) or even a Synology (see this [blog post](https://williamlam.com/2025/06/vcf-9-0-offline-depot-using-synology.html)).

2. **Create bootable ESXi USB installers**

üìí **IMPORTANT:** You MUST use **ESXi 9.0.0.0 build 24755229** (or the version specified in your VCF 9.0.0.0 release notes). Using a different ESXi version will cause VCF deployment failures.

**ISO Location:** `VMware-VMvisor-Installer-9.0.0.0.24755229.x86_64.iso` from your VCF Offline Depot at `PROD/COMP/ESX_HOST/`

**Create USB installers using the automated script:**

```bash
# Dry run first (preview without changes)
uv run scripts/create_esxi_usb.py --dry-run /dev/disk2 1

# Create USB for each host
sudo make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=1
sudo make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=2
sudo make usb-create USB=/dev/disk2 HOST=3
```

**Alternative:** Manual creation using [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) (see steps below)

3. We will be performing a scripted installation of ESXi (aka ESXi Kickstart) to remove the number of manual steps that would be needed during the post-installation of ESXi.

4. Edit the ESXi kickstart configuration files and replace the following values with your own desired configurations:
   * [`config/ks-esx01.cfg`](config/ks-esx01.cfg) for first physical host
   * [`config/ks-esx02.cfg`](config/ks-esx02.cfg) for second physical host

üí° To simplify the deployment of multiple ESXi hosts using a single USB drive, you can [create custom UEFI boot menu for ESXi](https://williamlam.com/2025/07/custom-uefi-boot-menu-for-esxi-9-0-using-refind.html), allowing you to select specific ESXi Kickstart configuration files.

üìí In order to identify the NVMe device label for the ESXi Installation and `ESXI_NVME_TIERING_AND_OSDATA_AND_VMFS` variable, you will need to boot the ESXi installer intially and switch to console (ALT+F1) and login with `root` and blank for the password (just hit enter). Enable SSH `/etc/init.d/SSH start` and then identify the IP Address which will allow you to SSH to ESXi host, which is running in memory and run the `vdq -q` command and list all storage devices. Identify the device you wish to use for ESX OS-Data, NVMe Tiering & local VMFS and make a note of the label as shown in the screenshot below.

After creating the bootable ESXi installer on your USB device, copy your modified [ks-esx01.cfg](config/ks-esx01.cfg)/[ks-esx02.cfg](config/ks-esx02.cfg) into the root directory of the USB device, which should be renamed to `KS.CFG` (all caps)

Now, navigate into the USB device under `EFI/BOOT` and edit `BOOT.CFG` and update the `kernelopt` so it matches the following which will run our KS.CFG instead of the interactive installation:

```code
bootstate=0

```

üìí If you are performing the installation on two physical ESXi host, the only change that is required is to update KS.CFG for ks-esx01.cfg and ks-esx02.cfg respecitvely, you can even change it to `KS1.CFG` and `KS2.CFG` to ensure you know which one was copied onto the USB device.

5. Plug the USB device into your system and power on to begin the ESXi installation. If you are performing a scripted installation, you may come across this warning, you can ignore and either wait or press enter to continue with the installation

![](screenshots/screenshot-2.jpg)

6. Once the ESXi reboot (there is a secondary reboot as part of the ESXi scripted installation), you should be able to login to your ESXi host using the FQDN and see something like the following:

![](screenshots/screenshot-3.png)

7. (Optional) If you do not already have a DNS server running within your enviornment or would like to localized this setup, you can deploy a VMware PhotonOS VM and use that as your DNS server. You can use my [unbound.conf](config/unbound.conf) as an exmaple setup and copy it to `/etc/unbound` directory after installing Unbound following the snippet below:

```
tdnf update -y
tdnf install unbound -y
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl disable iptables
systemctl enable unbound
systemctl restart unbound

rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
cat > /etc/resolv.conf <<EOF
nameserver 172.30.0.2
search vcf.lab
EOF
```

üìí If you are going to run a local DNS Server on the ESXi hosts that will deploy VCF 9.0, you should specify the final DNS Server IP Address and DNS Domain when provisioning your ESXi hosts. This will ensure that everything will resolve once you deploy your DNS Server, which will happen _after_ your ESXi hosts have been provisioned and removes and additional step by needing to update the DNS information.

8. Deploy the VCF Installer appliance using the [`deploy_vcf_installer.py`](scripts/deploy_vcf_installer.py) script.

   **Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.8+ with uv (`make setup` and `make sync`)
   * OVFTool installed (download from [Broadcom Developer Portal](https://developer.broadcom.com/tools/open-virtualization-format-ovf-tool/latest))
   * VCF Installer OVA downloaded to your local system

   **Configuration:**
   Edit `config/vcf-config.yaml` to match your environment:
   * VCF Installer OVA path
   * Target ESXi host selection
   * VCF Installer networking (IP, hostname, passwords)
   * Network and datastore settings

   **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   # Preview deployment first (recommended)
   make deploy-vcf-installer-dry-run

   # Deploy VCF Installer
   make deploy-vcf-installer

   # Or use direct Python command
   uv run scripts/deploy_vcf_installer.py
   ```

   The script will deploy the VCF Installer appliance and wait for it to power on.

![](screenshots/screenshot-4.png)

9. After the VCF Installer is up and running, configure it using the [`setup_vcf_installer.py`](scripts/setup_vcf_installer.py) script.

   **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   # Preview configuration first (recommended)
   make setup-vcf-installer-dry-run

   # Configure VCF Installer
   make setup-vcf-installer

   # Or use direct Python command
   uv run scripts/setup_vcf_installer.py
   ```

   The script will wait for the VCF Installer UI to be ready, then apply the necessary configuration changes.

![](screenshots/screenshot-5.png)

10. Before we can deploy our VCF 9 envrionment, we need to connect to our VCF Offline Depot that you had setup from Step 1.

Open browser to VCF Installer (e.g. <https://sddcm01.vcf.lab/>) and login with username `admin@local` and the password you had configured from Step 8 and then click on `DEPOT SETTINGS AND BINARY MANAGEMENT` button.

![](screenshots/screenshot-6.png)

Connect to your VCF Offline Depot and it should show active if everything was configured correctly.

![](screenshots/screenshot-7.png)

Once the VCF metadata has been pulled from your VCF Offline Depot, click on the `DOWNLOAD` button to beging downlaoding the required VCF binaries and ensure you have `Success` status for each item listed in the table.

![](screenshots/screenshot-8.png)

11. Navigate back to the VCF Installer homepage and click on `DEPLOY USING JSON SPEC` to begin your VCF deployment.

![](screenshots/screenshot-9.png)

Upload your VCF deployment manifest and click `Next` to begin the validation.

**Choose the appropriate manifest:**

* **Two-node cluster:** Use [`vcf90-two-node.json`](config/vcf90-two-node.json) (requires `make fix-vsan-policy`)
* **Three-node cluster:** Use [`vcf90-three-node.json`](config/vcf90-three-node.json) (standard vSAN configuration)

üìí **Note:** The three-node configuration is recommended as it provides proper vSAN fault tolerance (FTT=1) and doesn't require the storage policy fix script.

![](screenshots/screenshot-10.png)

üìí You may encounter some of the pre-checks where you need to acknowledge to continue. I have noticed when using certain MikroTik devices, even though Jumbo Frames (MTU=9K) has been configured, it fails the validation but the deployment is still successful, so simply acknowledge the configuration

Once you have fixed and/or acknowledge all applicable pre-check, click on `DEPLOY` to start the deployment.

![](screenshots/screenshot-11.png)

12. **[IMPORTANT - Two-Node Deployments Only]** Fix vSAN ESA Storage Policy proactively to prevent deployment failure.

   **Background:** For two-node physical ESXi host deployments, the VCF deployment will fail after vCenter Server is deployed due to inability to apply the default vSAN ESA Storage Policy (which requires 3 hosts by default with FTT=1).

   **When to Run:** **ONLY if you used `vcf90-two-node.json`**. Three-node deployments using `vcf90-three-node.json` do NOT need this fix.

   **Proactive Fix:** Run the [`fix_vsan_esa_default_storage_policy.py`](scripts/fix_vsan_esa_default_storage_policy.py) script **immediately after starting the VCF deployment** (Step 11). This script monitors vCenter Server deployment and automatically updates the vSAN storage policy when created, preventing deployment failure.

   **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   # Preview what the script will do (recommended)
   make fix-vsan-policy-dry-run

   # Fix the storage policy
   make fix-vsan-policy

   # Or use direct Python command
   uv run scripts/fix_vsan_esa_default_storage_policy.py
   ```

   ![](screenshots/screenshot-12.png)

   The script will:

* Wait until vCenter Server is available (monitors ping and connection readiness)
* Wait for vSAN ESA Storage Policy creation
* Automatically update the policy from FTT=1 to FTT=0 (required for 2-node)
* Prevent deployment failure that would require manual remediation

   ![](screenshots/screenshot-13.png)

   **Note:** This step is **only required** for two-host deployments. Three or more host deployments do not need this fix. The script automatically detects host count from `config/vcf-config.yaml` and skips execution if not needed.

13. The deployment will take a few hours and once everything has been deployed, you should see a success page like the following:

![](screenshots/screenshot-14.png)

You can login to your brand new VCF 9.0 deployment by clicking on the link to login to VCF Operations and `admin` credentials you had specified in your deployment manifest.

## Troubleshooting

### ESXi Installation Issues

**Problem:** Cannot identify NVMe device labels for kickstart configuration

* **Solution:** Boot ESXi installer, press ALT+F1, login as root (blank password), run `/etc/init.d/SSH start`, then SSH to the host and run `vdq -q` to list all storage devices

**Problem:** ESXi kickstart installation fails to boot

* **Solution:** Verify `BOOT.CFG` has been edited correctly with `kernelopt=ks=usb:/KS.CFG` and that the KS.CFG file is in the root of the USB device

**Problem:** Wrong ESXi host gets wrong configuration

* **Solution:** Consider renaming kickstart files to `KS1.CFG` and `KS2.CFG` and creating custom UEFI boot menu (see [this blog post](https://williamlam.com/2025/07/custom-uefi-boot-menu-for-esxi-9-0-using-refind.html))

### VCF Installer Deployment Issues

**Problem:** OVFTool fails with authentication error

* **Solution:** Verify SSH is enabled on ESXi host and credentials are correct in the script

**Problem:** OVFTool fails with network/datastore not found error

* **Solution:** Verify port group name (e.g., `VM Network`) and datastore name (e.g., `local-vmfs-datastore-1`) match exactly in the script

**Problem:** VCF Installer appliance doesn't get IP address

* **Solution:** Check network configuration in script (IP, gateway, subnet mask) and verify VLAN configuration on physical switch

### VCF Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Pre-check validation fails for MTU/Jumbo Frames

* **Solution:** If using MikroTik devices, this is a known issue. Acknowledge the warning if you've confirmed Jumbo Frames are configured correctly

**Problem:** vSAN ESA Storage Policy error on two-node deployment

* **Solution:** Run `make fix-vsan-policy` (or `uv run scripts/fix_vsan_esa_default_storage_policy.py`) immediately after starting VCF deployment (see Step 12)

**Problem:** VCF Offline Depot connection fails

* **Solution:** Verify HTTP server is running, firewall allows traffic, and the depot URL is correct. HTTPS is not required for VCF 9.0

**Problem:** Binary download fails from Offline Depot

* **Solution:** Verify all binaries are in the correct directory structure and the HTTP server has read permissions

### DNS Issues

**Problem:** Hostnames not resolving during deployment

* **Solution:** Verify DNS server is running and reachable, all required DNS entries are configured, and ESXi hosts have correct DNS settings

**Problem:** DNS server not accessible after deployment

* **Solution:** If running DNS on ESXi host, verify the VM is powered on and the DNS service (unbound) is running

### Network Issues

**Problem:** VLANs not working correctly

* **Solution:** Verify VLAN IDs are configured on physical switch, trunk ports are configured correctly, and VLANs match between physical switch and VCF deployment manifest

**Problem:** 10GbE connectivity issues

* **Solution:** Verify SFP+ cables/transceivers are compatible, ports are enabled on switch, and link lights are active on both ends
